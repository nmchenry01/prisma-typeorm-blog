# TypeORM Demo

A basic demo of [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/) functionality including CRUD, transactions, and raw SQL queries.

## Running Locally

The following steps assume the docker-compose setup in the root of the repository is running:

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
 
2. Run `npm run build` and `npm start`. You should see console output indicating the demo was successful
